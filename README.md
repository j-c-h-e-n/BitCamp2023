# BitCamp2023
The purpose of this project was to track UMD Dining Hall capacity.
There are 3 diners: *Yahentamitsi*, *251 North*, and *South Campus Diner*.

An end-user could open the webpage, then choose the diner of their interest. The new page would then reveal how full the diner is at that hour.

**Challenges:**
  - Learning new languages and creating a project in an incredibly quick and limited amount of time.
  - Finding data to base our tracking on.
    - Google's Places API apparently does not support retrieving an estimated amount of people at an establishment.
    - There were no third party "Places API" that could substitute for our purposes.
    - We had to creatively improvise using the busyness graph provided by Google Places regarding a location.
  - Experience front-end and back-end development in a close-knit group.
  - Planning division of labor and applying our best knowledge and strengths.

**Potential future development ideas:**
  - Suggestions and predictions for end-users to better plan their diner trip.
  - Provide the full menu of the respective diner.
    - Provide the ability to sort through the different food types, as well as food locations.
